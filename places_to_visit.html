            <h1>Places to Visit in the Dominican Republic</h1>
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>The Dominican Republic is the most popular travel destination in the Caribbean. Every year, over five million travelers from around the world 
arrive in the tropical island nation.</p>

<p>The diverse geography, which ranges from lush forests and mountains to semi-desert areas, also creates unique opportunities for travelers who 
want more than a simple beach vacation.</p>

<p>Here are some of the places to travel to in the Dominican Republic.</p>

<h2>North</h2>
<h3>Puerto Plata</h3>
<!--No menciona el teleferico, el acuario, y la fortaleza como sitios para visitar en la cuidad-->
<p>Puerto Plata is a province on the Dominican Republic&#39s Atlantic north coast. Its capital is San Felipe de Puerto Plata, a city best known for its beaches. 
The city&#39s old colonial-era center is dominated by the 16th-century Fortaleza San Felipe, a Spanish fortress that now houses historical and military artifacts. Puerto Plata has many places to visit, but some of well known are 
Playa Dorada and Cabarete.</p>
<h3>Plata Dorada</h3>
<p>Playa Dorada is a beautiful and lengthy stretch of beach known backed by resorts and an 18-hole golf course. This golden-sand beach is lined with luxury resorts.  This area is subdued and has more of a tranquil feel since 
its beaches are not busy with boats and water sports, although it's a beautiful area for swimming or snorkeling. You can walk beyond the resorts to undeveloped beaches backed by palm trees and forest.</p>
<h3>Cabarete</h3>
<p>Cabarete is known for its relaxed atmosphere and huge, crescent-shaped beach lined with casual restaurants where visitors can dine right on the sand.  The calm waters, combined with breezy conditions on make it a center 
for water sports like kiteboarding and surfing.</p>
<p>In the early evenings, especially on weekends and Tuesdays, musicians often perform in the local beachfront restaurants and provide entertainment as the sun sets.</p>
<p>Cabarete hosts the annual Master of the Ocean competition in February, where the best in the world come to compete in kitesurfing, windsurfing, surfing, and stand up paddleboarding.</p>

<h3>Saman&#225</h3>
<p>Saman&#225 is a province on Northwest coast of the Dominican Republic.  Its capital is also named Saman&#225 (Santa B&#225rbara de Saman&#225) and it's a town on the Saman&#225 Peninsula. The town overlooks Saman&#225 Bay, which plays host 
to thousands of humpback whales during winter&#39s mating season. Nearby, the Whale Museum&#39s prime attraction is a huge whale skeleton. The town&#39s waterfront promenade, the Malec&#243n, has restaurants and bars. 
In the bay, Cayo Levantado is a tiny island known for its palm-lined beaches.</p>
<p>Whale watching tours are only available in the period from December 15 to March 30 of every year when about 2,000 humpback whales come to reproduce in the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>Saman&#225 Bay is the last stop Christopher Columbus made in the New World in 1493 before heading back to Spain.</p>
<!--Found out about Las Galeras after doing research on Las Terrenas-->
<h3>Las Galeras</h3>
<p>Las Galeras is on the east coast of the Saman&#225 Peninsula. Las Galeras, in English The Galleys (a galley was a war ship where prisoners and slaves were used to move the ship), is named as 
such because two galleys stayed here during the 16th century.</p>

<p>In recent years Las Galeras has been a popular destination for backpackers and travelers in general due to its remote beaches, the possibility of camping and hiking and the fact that it is 
literally on the end of the road of the peninsula.</p>

<h3>Las Terrenas</h3>
<p>Las Terrenas is a busy resort town with a peaceful and laid-back beachfront area, where winding, single-lane dirt roads meander past small French caf&#233s and lookout over palms, beaches, and the aquamarine ocean</p>

<p>It's known for central Las Terrenas Beach. Other beaches include Bonita, Cos&#243n and Las Ballenas. Cays off the coast feature underwater caverns like Dudu cave. Bars and restaurants, many with open-air seating, line 
the strip of Fishermen Town (Spanish: Pueblo de los Pescadores) near the water.  Like Las Galeras, many French people have made Las Terrenas their home and have set up restaurants and inns.</p>

<h2>Dominican Alps</h2>
<h3>Jarabacoa</h3>
<p>Jarabacoa is home to astounding cloud-towering sights, waterfalls, treks, paragliding, river rafting, and other nature tours. Jarabacoa is also less than an hour away from the Jos&#233 Armando 
Berm&#250dez National Park which is home to the tallest mountain in the Caribbean, Pico Duarte </p>

<p>Jarabacoa is the capital of extreme mountain sports in the Dominican Republic with many well-organized operators offering river rafting, mountain biking, rappelling, canyoning, paragliding and 
mountain trekking adventures. Canyoning is practiced alongside the impressive Salto de Jimenoa and Baiguate waterfalls. Mountain biking routes are set out all throughout the mountain areas, 
categorized according to difficulty.</p>

<h2>East</h2>
<h3>Punta Cana</h3>
<p>Punta Cana is a 60 miles stretch of coastline with mainly shallow waters, with beaches that face both the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The ocean is a flurry of activity, with 
boats, parasailers, and tour boats coming and going.</p>

<p>Bavaro Beach is Punta Cana&#39s most impressive stretch of beach, where you can wade into the water or walk for hours along the sand.</p>


<h2>South</h2>
<h3>La Romana (Southeast)</h3>
<p>La Romana is a province on the Dominican Republic&#39;s Caribbean southeast coast and whose capital, by the same name, is a gateway to nearby resort areas. Overflowing in natural riches&#45;from 
a poster&#45;worthy Caribbean coastline to world&#45;class golf courses&#45;La Romana is one of the country&#39;s top destination picks. Fields of sugar cane lead to continuous white sand beaches from Dominicus 
to Bayah&#237;be. Cave&#45;riddled forests inside Cotubanam&#225 National Park are home to fresh water springs and Taino rock art. Offshore, the islands of Saona, Catalina, and Catalinita are lined with 
turtle nesting stretches facing pristine coral reefs, while shipwrecks teeming with marine life rest at shallow and extreme depths.

The largest sugar cane mill in the Americas was once headquartered in La Romana, until its owners diversified and ventured into tourism by opening the luxurious Casa de Campo Resort in 1974, a 
celebrity favorite and renowned destination for its award-winning Pete Dye golf courses. The adjacent 16th century Altos de Chav&#243;n followed&#45;a stunning replica of a Mediterranean village towering 
over the Chav&#243;n River, and bustling with entertainment&#45;including an outdoor Grecian amphitheater where Grammy-winning artists perform every year.</p>

<!--Took out the cave of wonders.  It is not in Juan Dolio-->
<h3>Juan Dolio (Southeast)</h3>
<p>An hour east of the capital city of Santo Domingo and the <a href="colonialcity.html">Colonial City</a> is the cosmopolitan beach town of Juan Dolio. 
A favorite of well-heeled urbanites who flock here on weekends, Juan Dolio&#39;s 10-kilometer (six-mile) long, spacious and sparkling white sand beach is dotted with hotels, dive shops, restaurants, 
and bars, as well as a variety of vacation homes, upscale residential communities, and newly built condominiums.</p>

<h3>Pedernales (Southwest)</h3>
<p>Tucked in the southwestern most corner of the Dominican Republic, bordering Haiti, the Pedernales province is as remote as it gets. Yet this distant, desert-like coastal landscape beckons the 
ultimate outdoor explorer&#45;a place where giant cacti line the roads with intermittent views of iridescent turquoise shores, where cows and iguanas are a frequent sight, and where naturalists will find 
the country&#39;s most significant reserves.</p>

<p>Pedernales is home to the Jaragua National Park, an ecotourist heaven.  Jaragua National Park is one of DR&#39;s most significant natural reserves; part of the first UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in the DR, 
the park encompass diverse ecosystems&#45;from sea to land, lagoon to isles, and a rich and diverse wildlife.</p>

<p>Jaragua National Park encompasses Eagles' Bay (Spanish: Bahia de Las Aguilas), a five-miles long strech of beach recognized as the most beautiful beach in the Dominican Republic.  The park is home to the 
Oviedo Lagoon (Spanish: Laguna de Oviedo), the largest lagoon in DR, with a salt-water level three times higher than that of the sea, Laguna de Oviedo is a prime bird watching area. Around the lagoon&#39;s 
thick mangrove swamps and 24 keys you&#39;ll spot royal and blue herons, the great egret, roseate spoonbills, sandpipers, and flamingos.</p>
