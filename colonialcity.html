            <p>The Colonial City (Spanish: Ciudad Colonial) of Santo Domingo has high historical value to the country; hence, it was named as the only site to make the list of UNESCO World Heritage 
            Sites in the Dominican Republic. This historic central neighborhood is the oldest permanent settlement established by the Europeans in the New World. When Christopher Columbus 
            arrived on the island in 1492, a few structures were built including a cathedral, customs house, university, and a hospital. This was the first time that this was done in any 
            of the Americas. The colonial town was therefore officially established in 1498. It featured a grid pattern that was to be the model of town planning in the future settlements 
            for all other colonial cities.</p>

            <p>Aside from the establishment of the first colonial town, the colonial zone of the city also features a high concentration of important historical landmarks. Some of these 
            landmarks include the Columbus Alcazar, Cathedral of Santa Mar&#237a la Menor, and the Ozama Fortress.</p>

                <p>The Columbus Alcazar (Spanish: Alc&#225;zar de Col&#243;n) is the oldest Viceregal residence in the Americas, and forms 
                part of the Ciudad Colonial UNESCO's World Heritage Site. It was built on a plot close to the rock islet 
                that look towards the Ozama River, granted to Diego Columbus (Spanish: Diego  , firstborn son of the discoverer of the Americas, Christopher Columbus, by 
                King Ferdinand II of Aragon, to build a dwelling for him and his descendants on the island Hispaniola, to which he arrived in 1509 as governor. 
        
                <p>The building houses the Diego Columbus Alcazar Museum (Spanish: Museo Alc&#225;zar de Diego Col&#243;n), whose collection exhibits the Caribbean's most important ensemble 
                of European late medieval and Renaissance works of art, which were acquired in the 1950s. The Tapestry collection (spanning from the 15th to 17th centuries) is 
                particularly important and unique in the Caribbean, and includes pieces produced by the Flemish Van Den Hecke family from cartouches created by Charles Le Brun.</p>
        
                <p>The Alc&#225;zar is the most visited museum in Santo Domingo. The palace is an impressive construction of coralline blocks that once housed some fifty 
                rooms and a number of gardens and courtyards, although what remains today is about half the size it once was. It was built under Diego Col&#243;n, the son 
                of Christopher Columbus; when he became the 4th Governor of the Indies in 1509, he ordered the construction of a family home and governor's mansion 
                between 1510 and 1512. The architectural style is gothic mudejar typical of the early 16th century. During the early Spanish colonial period, the 
                mansion occupied a very important place in history. It was from here that many expeditions of conquest and exploration were planned. In 1586, the 
                palace was sacked by Sir Francis Drake and his forces.</p> 
        
                <p>As the influence of Santo Domingo waned, the house fell into ruins, and by the mid-18th century was abandoned and in danger of rotting away. It was 
                rescued and extensively restored between 1955 and 1957, being filled with period furniture, artwork, and other accessories. A self-guided tour using a 
                portable audio speaker that discusses each room's function is available in various languages.</p>

            <p>The Cathedral of Santa Mar&#237a la Menor(Spanish: Catedral of Santa Mar&#237a la Menor) is dedicated to St. Mary of the Incarnation. 
            It is the oldest cathedral in the Americas, begun in 1512 and completed in 1540. It is the Cathedral of the 
            Archbishop of Santo Domingo who has the honorary title of Primate of the Americas (Spanish: Primada de America) because Santo Domingo 
            was the first Catholic diocese established in the New World.</p>

            <p>The Cathedral is fronted with a golden-tinted coral limestone facade, the church combines elements of both Gothic and Baroque 
            with some lavish plateresque styles as exemplified by the high altar chiseled out of silver. There is also a treasury which has 
            an excellent art collection of ancient woodcarvings, furnishings, funerary monuments, silver, and jewelry..</p>

            <img class="img" src="images/fortaleza_ozama.jpg">
            <p>The Ozama Fortress (Spanish: Fortaleza Ozama) was built in 1502 by the Spanish at the entrance to Santo Domingo's Ciudad Colonial, Dominican Republic, and 
            overlooking the Ozama River. Named after this river, the castle, also referred to as "La Fortaleza" or "The Fortress", is the oldest formal military construction of European
            origin in the Americas. It was declared by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, together with the other historical monuments of the Ciudad Colonial.<p>

            <p>An impressive architectural structure of medieval style and design, the Tower of Homage (Spanish: Torre del Homenaje) stands in the center of the grounds. The castle was designed 
            to guard the entrance to the port of Santo Domingo and defend the city from seaborne enemies. Construction began in 1502 and it was completed in 1505. The entrance gate on Calle 
            Damas was originally built in 1608, known as the Prevention Gate.</p>

            <p>The castle was well-built enough to serve as a prison until the 1960s. When the prison was closed, the "Fortaleza" was opened to the public. It is located at the end of Las 
            Damas Street.</p>
